The following source code is of a very basic engine using OpenGL API using C++. 
The said engine has and can do the following:-

* Create basic 2D/3D shapes and objects using triangles.
* Apply Textures and material attributes to objects.
* Has basic lighting system(Ambient, Diffuse and Specular)
* Move in 3D space using WSAD keys and control camera in any axis using mouse.

The Engine in this current state displays 10 cubes with textures applied to them. The player controlled camera emites a spotlight which demonstrates the mapping of texture and how it's "materials" react to the light.
